### About
A single-page, simple resume for software engineers. This document uses the base LaTex templates and fonts which allow the users to easily install and maintain their resume. Sections are documented and separated by keeping LaTex formatting standards in mind to allow for easy updates to the resume.

### Background
I started using LaTex and liked the amount of control I had over my documents. I wanted to create a common use template to write and update my resume using LaTeX and also wanted to share this with everyone else.
